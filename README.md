# Heart Disease Prediction using SVM

This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. The project uses a **support vector machine (SVM)** classifier to perform the prediction task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]. The dataset contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, including the target attribute `target` which indicates whether the person has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Requirements & Usage

The project requires the following libraries and packages:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn 
```
To run the project, you can use the following command:

1. After installing the dependencies, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Talha4k/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git

   This notebook contain the code and explanation of the task.

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy of **82%** on the test set using the SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
